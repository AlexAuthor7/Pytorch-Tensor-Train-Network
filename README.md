# Tensor-Train-Neural-Network

The 'tc' folder includes all supporting python files for building TensorTrain neural networks. Specifically,\
  tc.tc_cores.py: core TensorTrain bases  \
  tc.tc_decomp.py: tensor decompostion files \
  tc.tc_fc.py: TensorTrain Neural Network \
  tc.tc_init.py: Intialize model parameters of TensorTrain models \
  tc.tc_math.py: TensorTrain mathematical operations

Some of the advanced CNN architectures can be found in the 'cnn' folder.

``speech.extract_feat.py`` extracts both clean and noisy featuers for speech enhancement.

``train_tt.py`` trains a TensorTrain model for speech enhancement.
