# TC: Tensor-Train-Neural-Network

The package particularly aims at Tensor Decompositions to Deep Neural Networks, particularly for Tensor-to-Vector Regression tasks, e.g., Speech and Image Enhancement. 

```
git clone https://github.com/uwjunqi/Tensor-Train-Neural-Network.git
cd Tensor-Train-Neural-Network
```

## Installation
